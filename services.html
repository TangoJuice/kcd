          <p>We have made available in-house to our patients as of 2015 - advanced digital scanning technology in 3M True Definition.</p>
          <p>Digital impressions are faster because they take less chair time, cases are uploaded to lab the same day, resulting much quicker turn-around time.  The scans make the process easier by being more comfortable for patients - no more gummy, sticky impression material inside patient's mouth, and for the office - simplified, fully digital workflow and requiring less staff time (no disinfecting impressions, no paperwork, noo packing and shipping of cases)</p>
          <p>The process is 'greener', more accurate, the the scan is stored digitally without distortion for as long as needed.</p>
          <p>Digital scan can be utilized instead of traditional impression in almost all aspects of dentistry.  We are happy to offer this advance technology to our valuable patients without additional cost!</p>

          <p><strong>Invisalign</strong> is a contemporary method for straightening teeth and a great alternative to traditional orthodontics. There are not metal wires or brackets. Instead, Invisalign is comprised of a series of clear aligners that are custom made to help shift teeth into ideal placement. This is a convenient way to straighten teeth, bringing very little interference to everyday life. The aligners are virtually invisible, meaning people won't even know you're wearing them. With invisalign, you can eat whatever you want and are able to brush and floss like normal. Invisalign is made with 3-D imaging technology which has been proven very efficient and effective. All of our general dentist at KC Dental are trained and experienced with Invisalign and have had great success in helping their patient's achieve their desired smile and correcting misalignment through use of Invisalign.

      </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 services-text">
          <p>The word periodontal literally means "around the tooth." Periodontal diseases, more commonly known as gum disease, are a family of serious bacterial infections that destroy the attachment fibers and supporting bone that hold your teeth in your mouth.</p>
          <p>Gum disease is the leading cause of tooth loss in America today. Regular dental visits are the best insurance for maintaining healthy gums. Our general dentists examine your gums and provide preventative care to keep your gums healthy.</p>
          <p>Should you need further treatment, don't worry because at KC Dental we have our own in-house periodontist, Dr. Siddharth Gupta, to take care of your periodontic needs comfortably and professionally. No more going from office to office for qualified periodontic care! In addition to the treatment of periodontal (gum) disease, Dr. Gupta also specializes in sinus augmentation, as well as the exciting new field of dental implants.</p>
          <h6>Dental Implants: Creating Healthy New Smiles!</h6>
          <p>Dental implants represent one of the most important advances in periodontics. Implants offer patients with missing or extremely damaged teeth the opportunity to once again enjoy a fully functional bite. Best of all, recent advances in implant technology have made them extremely successful and they are often the ideal solution for a number of dental conditions.</p>
          <p>Rather than resting on the gum line like removable dentures, or using adjacent teeth as anchors like fixed bridges, dental implants are long-term replacements that your oral and maxillofacial surgeon surgically places in the jawbone.</p>
          <p>A dental implant designed to replace a single tooth is composed of three parts: the titanium implant that fuses with the jawbone; the abutment, which fits over the portion of the implant that protrudes from the gum line; and the crown, which is created by our in-house experts and fitted onto the abutment for a natural appearance.</p>
          <p>With an overall success rate of about 95% and almost 50 years of clinical research to back them up, dental implants are frequently the best treatment option for replacing missing teeth.</p>
          <p>Call us today to schedule a consultation and speak with Dr. Gupta about your periodontic needs!</p>

          <p>Many people who wear dentures suffer from ill-fitting dentures making eating and talking difficult and painful. With the advances of modern dentistry, we can offer an alternative to traditional denture by combining implants and dentures. With Snap-On dentures, you can get more comfortable and natural results than with traditional dentures- all without sacrificing on quality. Your denture can be secured with using as few as two implants.</p>
          <p>Being able to use fewer implants is not only more cost effective, but also shortens healing time making the process of getting your snap on smile much quicker. With snap in denture stabilization you get the support you need to help keep your denture stay in place while still being able to remove the denture so it can be properly cleaned and cared for.</p>
          <p>Since the implant is placed in your jawbone like an actual tooth root, they prevent bone lost and facial collapse. While they won't be as stable as using a full set of implants, it does mean no more worries bout your denture slipping around or falling out.</p>
          <p>Currently, we are offering complimentary evaluation with our doctors to see if affordable dental implants can work for you. Call us today!</p>
